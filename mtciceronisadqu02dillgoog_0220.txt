let ur suffer ignorant teachers to instil their ridicu-

He alludes to Corax, a Siciliau teacher of rhetoric,
’ who the Greeks say was worthy of his name. Tho

¹ 11614. Pamphilum. Suidas mentions many
of this narne3 omong' others, a philosopher, whether
cf Amphipolis or Sicyon is uncertain, who wrote
concerning pointing and distinguished painters.
This is probably the one referred to in the text.

116.19. Dummodo . . . . uideatur, i. e. if that
subject bc considered of so much importance as to
be comprehended in no smaller space than all the
books of philosophare. '

116 20. Oralorum. In some editions we find
rhetorum for this word; the reason assigned for a
preference of the latter word is, that Pamphilus
and Corax, who have been just spoken of, were
rhetoriciaus, not orators3 Crassus attacks their
ignorance and impudenoe in pretending to t'each
eloquence when they were themselves uuacquainted
with the principles of moral philosophy, so neces-
sary to an orator. '
