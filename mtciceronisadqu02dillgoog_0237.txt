“The two volumen before us, we observe, are printed
and bound so as to match, and we understand it is blr.
Dillaway‘s purpose to add to the series, a purpose which

From tlrc Bibiiral Repository‚ October, 1837.

“The latter of these worhs, (De Officiis) has long
been studled in most os the colleges and higher semr-
naries of New England. The trectises contained ln the

¹other, (De Senectute etde Amicitia,) though hardly
less valucble, have not, we believe, been so generally
used aa text-bools, but are much read in private. Mr.
Dillawcy has donea cod service to the cause os clas·
sioal learning and oig good toste, and sound morale, in

style and the purity of their sentiments. Ayoun man
can hardly rise srom the perusal of thern without eeliog

a certain elevation of thought, and strengtbening of
virtuous purposes; while cs specimens oi pure language
and sair writing, they cannot bc too caresully studied.
